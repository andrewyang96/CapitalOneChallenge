Description
-----------
Use the Instagram API to build an application (in Ruby, Python, NodeJS, or another language of your choice) that will find trends about Capital One on social media:

1. Get the 20 latest posts for #CapitalOne, and the like count for each. 
2. Get info about each of the users who posted those 20 latest posts: determine how many posts they have on Instagram, how many followers they have and how many people they follow. 
3. Determine how many posts are positive towards Capital One, how many are negative, and how many are simply neutral.

Bonus Deliverable (optional):

4. Fetch more posts than just 20, and generate some sort of visual that shows whether #CapitalOne is trending positively or negatively. (hint - try out D3 or something similar).
